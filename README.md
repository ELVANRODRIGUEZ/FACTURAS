# **FACTURAS**

**DESCRIPTION**

This is very handy web app that takes in an XML Mexican invoice (or a bunch of them) and read through each one to get certain information that is then shown within a table. Info like provider data, fiscal UUID, invoice total ammount, invoice ammount without taxes etc. Additionally, it calculates some more data to show the user how deductible that invoice might be.
